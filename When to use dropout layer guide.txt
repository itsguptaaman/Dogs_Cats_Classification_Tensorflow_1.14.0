Q Where to place Dropout Layer???
A. 

1. Before Flattening Layer [FC]

2. After Flattening Layer [FC]Eg 
Convo2d --> Convo2d --> Max-pooling --> Dropout (In between the dense layer)

Q What not to do??
* Before Flattening Layer:
1. Away from flatterning minimum two, three layers.
Q Why???
A Whe we are at the last part before flaterning it means features are pretty much ready,
at that point of time we dont want to loose information
2. Not at top, why???
A. Because it is the first step of extracting information
If it was my last convolution block 
Do not use dropout layer.

**Summary**
Before Flatterning
1. Do not use it in first Convolution block.
2. Do not use it in last Convolution block.
3. Do not use it in any transition block(Max pooling layer).

After Flatterning
1. After Flatterning
2. You can place it in betwen FC 
3. Any place before Activation function
